I want to create a FileTree plugin for Neovim.
Its main features will be:

1. Displaying the FileTree in the left sidebar.
2. Displaying files in tree mode.
3. Possible movement between directories
4. Display file type icon on front of file name.
5. Change the current directory to the target directory when navigating to it.

First, I need to understand how to open the sidebar using a command.
My instruction u read by this link: [[Open sidebar]]
